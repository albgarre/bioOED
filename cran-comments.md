## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Done some changes in the vignette to try and avoid the additional file generated by MEIGO.
* Same for some of the examples.

## Test environments

* Windows 7, R version 3.4.2
* OS X Yosemite 10.10.2, R version 3.5.3

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Reverse dependencies

I have run devtools::revdep_check() and every package passed.
